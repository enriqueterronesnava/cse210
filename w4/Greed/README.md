# GREED
Gems (z) and rocks (O) randomly appear and fall from the top of the screen.
The player (#) can move left or right along the bottom of the screen.
If the player touches a gem they earn 25 points.
If the player touches a rock they lose 75 points.
Gems and rocks are removed when the player touches them.
If the player loses all the points the game ends and have to close the window.
The game continues until the player closes the window.
